Virtual Farm via Zoom, Google Meet + similar broadcasting products.<br>
<br>
We are so excited to know we can talk to people around the world about our farm, to educate, tell stories and show you our mini farm friends live online!<br>
From 30 to 60 minutes, Farmer Fiona, Karen or Glenn will join you and your group for an interactive chat that highlights our Critters. We can set up weekly, semi-monthly or regularly scheduled visits.<br>
You can take the lead and we call into you, or we can set up the call and welcome your guests to the session. Your session leader will ensure all members are logged in before setting guidelines for the day. (participation, muting microphones, etc). Our farmer team will then lead the lively discussion and interact with your group. From facts to silly trivia, we set the tone to your needs. We can work with school curriculum themes, select a breed to focus on or look at similar traits in a few Critters. Farmer Fiona will ask questions and bring joy from our farm to you.<br>
We’ll work with your team leader in advance to best set up the theme of the day and check out technical bugs.<br>
Our Critters include: Nigerian Dwarf Goats, Babydoll Sheep, Alpacas, Miniature Donkeys, Shetland Ponies, Funky Chicken breeds, Rabbits, Call Ducks, Ducks, Geese, Cows and Guinea Hens. We sometimes have a hatch happening and your group can watch as chicks or ducklings pip and pop out of their shells right on camera. Bunnies are born and perhaps your timing can see the smallest of our furry bunnies. Call back in a few weeks and see the progression! When our kids (goats) and lambs (sheep) arrive, we love to show them off to you as well. We may be in our studio, outside or in the barn for your call. It’s always a happy surprise.<br>
Session Fees are $100 for 30 minutes or $175 for one hour (plus tax).<br>
You can book online, stating your preferred date and time in the comment area as you check out OR email to karen@CritterVisits.ca with your request. We would be happy to send you a detailed invoice. Payment options include credit cards and e-transfers.<br>
Book a scheduled set of sessions or just one. We’re here to enhance your programming! Call to chat and set up something special today.<br>
