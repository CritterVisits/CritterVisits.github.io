      <p class="subtitle"><span class="header">COVID 2020</span> Schools may be closed, but home classes are happening. Our incubators are being rented by people all over to experience the hatching right at home. Plesae email with your contact information and type of egg you wish to hatch. We will advise you of the next opening as fast as we can get to your email. We are curently booking 2 months ahead of today as your start date. WE ARE NOT offering any travel services at this time. Clients must come to our farm in Lakehurst. We have strict protocols in place to keep you and our farm healthy.<br>
        No matter where you are in Ontario - (once you pick up the kit from the farm in Lakehurst, Ontario) we are right there to virtually support you ! Needing a special, personal &quot;eggs-perience&quot;? Woolley Wonderland Farm is happy to help time a clutch of eggs to hatch with you for a birthday or other milestone. It's a super way to provide egg-citement when parties just can't happen like before.      </p>
      <p class="subtitle"><span class="header">WHO CAN HATCH?</span> Whether in your classroom as part of the curriculum or in a senior's home as you count down the days to the hatch, we will be right there to support! What about hatching in your own home for home schooling or a personal &quot;eggs-perience&quot;?  Woolley Wonderland Farm is happy to time a clutch of eggs to hatch with you for a birthday or other milestone.</p>
      <p class="subtitle"><span class="header">You won't feel alone</span> through the process. That is one of the joys of the <span class="sidebarHeader">support we offer.</span> Teachers and facilitators love that we are an <span class="sidebarHeader">email, text or call</span> away as they nervously try to hatch their first eggs. We are there to support you and make YOU the best ever in the wide-eyes as YOU lead the hatching process.</p>
      <p class="subtitle">The kit will have everything you need for your hatch. <br>
        We have over a dozen IncuView incubators. They have a clear, domed lid. It allows maximum viewing from every angle to see those eggs pip and hatch. The automatic tuner gently rolls the eggs so there is no need to turn them by hand. It will stop turning two days before the hatch date to let those eggs settle in time for the pipping out. We will provide the chick starter food and feeder. We put &quot;chick gatorade&quot;, a vitamin powder in a bottle to help kick-start the lives of your chicks. You will get a tote/brooder box to put the chicks in after they hatch with bedding (shavings) and a heat lamp to keep the right envirnoment for them to grow.  Raise the chicks about 10 days as they grow feathers and get their legs! Once the hatch is complete and you have enjoyed the chicks for a week or so, it's time to return the kit to the farm for a happy life laying eggs. Our breeds are heritage and show birds - high in demand by other breeders, farmers and backyard chicken lovers. We do not hatch MEAT BIRDS.  CONTACT us early to set up a date to get your eggs delivered.</p>
      <p class="subtitle"><span class="header">Some schools and school boards</span> have their own incubators - a superb investment! Woolley Wonderland is thrilled to provide you with eggs to hatch. You can use your own incubator and count down the miracle of birth. We'll be there to answer questions if you're nervous about the experience - it's actually quite fun and easy too. We will provide the chick starter food and vitamin powder for the water. Raise the chicks for a few weeks to watch them grow feathers and get their legs! Once the hatch is complete and your group has enjoyed the chicks for a week or so, we're happy to get them all back to the farm for a happy life laying eggs. CONTACT us early to set up a date to get your eggs delivered.<br>
