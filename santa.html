Santa and Sleigh at the Farm

We’ve opened our Farm and Santa has agreed to come and visit with you for just a few dates before his big night!<br>
Our online booking will show you available appointments on Saturdays, Sundays and the week of Christmas too.<br>
<br>
Arrive for your Farm Family Time and our elves will be on hand to guide you. Our Welcome Elf will check you in and collect your contact information (Covid regulations in the need of contact tracing) before escorting your group to meet the Jolly Old Elf himself!<br>
<br>
Santa and his “reindeer/pony” Angus will greet you at our photograph-friendly area. Decorated trees, a rocking horse, comfortable chair and the North Pole are settled into a bed of straw for the rustic feel of a barnyard Christmas. We’ll be asking in advance for your kiddo’s names, ages and other tidbits to make the visit real for them as Santa has a chat with your children. Angus can be brushed and petted as part of this time.<br>
A Professional Photographer may be on site to offer their services (additional fees will apply if you choose to use their expertise).<br>
You are welcome to take all the video footage and photos with your own camera during the 15 minutes with Santa.<br>
He has a small gift for the kiddos too!<br>
<br>
Next stop is our Sleigh Ride zone in the front field. Meadow and Oreo take turns pulling our red or gold sleighs. They will do laps around the field as your group fit into the seats beside our driver for a One-Pony-Open-Sleigh ride. We’ve had chorus’ of Jingle Bells spontaneously sung as kiddos are pulled by the Sleigh. We can fit two littles, a grown up and a little or just a grown up beside our elf driver. We can also lead the sleigh with your kiddos on the seat. During this 15-minute time, we will continue to take turns to allow everyone who wishes to have a spin.<br>
<br>
Say good-bye to your new Elf friends and head back to your car for a safe trip home.<br>
<br>
Fees are $75 per family of up to 6 (and we trust they are all from the same social bubble). HST is applied to all purchases.<br>
Read the full description again on the booking site and be careful what day and time you select as there are not refunds or changes allowed.<br>
<br>
If you are looking for a personal family experience at your location, we can also come to you with Santa, elves and the sleigh.<br>
Fees are $375 for an hour plus travel, tolls and taxes. Please call Elf Karen at 705 772-9999 to verify booking times and full details<br>

We follow the provincial guidelines for travel and sizes of outdoor groups. Please be sure you know what Zone you are currently in.<br>
