<p class=header>Santa and Sleigh at the Farm</p>
We’ve opened our Farm, and Santa has agreed to come and visit with you for just a few dates before his big night!
<br>Our <a class="ninja_link" href="https://crittervisits.square.site/">online booking</a> will show you available appointments on Saturdays, Sundays and the week of Christmas too.
<br>
<br><span class=secondary-header>Arrive</span> for your Farm Family Time and our Elves will be on hand to guide you. Our <b>“Welcome Elf”</b> will check you in and collect your contact information (for contact tracing with Covid regulations) before escorting your group to meet the “<b>Jolly Old Elf</b>“ himself!
<br>
<br><span class=secondary-header>Santa</span> and his “reindeer/pony” Angus will greet you at our photo-friendly area. Decorated trees, a rocking horse, cozy chair and the North Pole are settled into a bed of straw for the rustic feel of a Barnyard Christmas. We’ll be asking in advance for your kiddo’s names, ages and other details, to make the visit real for them as Santa has a chat with your children. Angus can be brushed and petted as part of this time.
<br><b>A Professional Photographer</b> will be on site to offer their services (additional fees from $20 will apply if you choose to use their expertise. You will arrange payment with them, and digital images will be sent to you directly.
<br><b>You are welcome</b> to take all the video footage and photos during the 15 minutes with Santa, who has a small gift for the kiddos too!
<br>
<br><span class=secondary-header>Our Sleigh Ride zone</span> in our front field where Meadow and Oreo take turns pulling our red or gold sleighs. They will do laps around the field for a One-Pony-Open-Sleigh ride. We’ve had chorus’ of Jingle Bells spontaneously sung as kiddos are pulled in the Sleigh. <b>We can fit</b> three littles, a grown-up and a little, or just a pair of grown-ups for each ride. During this 15-minute time, you will continue taking turns, allowing everyone who wishes to have a ride.
<br>
<br><span class=secondary-header>With a good-bye</span> to your new Elf friends, and head back to your car for a safe trip home.
<br>
<br><span class=header>Fees:</span> $75 per family of up to 6 (they must be from the same social bubble). HST is applied to all purchases.
<br>Re-read the full description again on the booking site. <b>There are no refunds or changes allowed.</b>
<br>
<br><span class=header>For a personal family experience at your location;</span> Santa, Elves and the sleigh can come to you.
<br><span class=header>Fees:</span> $375 for an hour plus travel, tolls and taxes. Please call Elf Karen at 705 772-9999 to verify possible custom booking times and full details.
