                      Joy and giggles, laughter and squeals of delight. These are the typical reaction as families use our contact-free pick-up of the tiny ducklings at our farm.<br>
                      Woolley Wonderland Farm in Lakehurst, Ontario is the location for all pick-ups and returns for this program.<br>
                      Perhaps you're a parent needing an idea for home learning with your elementary kiddos, or wanting to help a tween or teen dealing with isolation. Fostering a pair or more of baby ducklings has become a phenomenon. With the returning ducks, comes stories of how caring for ducklings brings together science and nature studies, empathy and nurturing, socializing and imprinting, compassion, caring and love.

                      This includes our comprehensive manual with detailed instructions and answers to questions like: Do duckies sleep? Does the heat lamp stay on all the time? What else do they eat? Do they poop a lot? (No suspense here, the answer is yes!) What is a duck diaper? Can we go outside? And more…<br>

                      Email is the most efficient way we communicate with all our clients. Watch your inbox (and junk mail) for the note to COME AND GET your DUCKLINGS! We curently have little to no wait time for ducklings to be placed into your hands. <br>
                      Our ducks are usually Pekins, yellow as ducklings with tiny peeps which grow into white ducks with orange beaks and legs.<br>
                      We sometimes get other breeds such as Indian Runners, Khaki Campbell, shiny Cayugas, fancy Crested Ducks, miniature Call Ducks and the occasional Goslings too, depending on what is available each hatch day. (CHICKS FLY TOO FAST for longer-term stays so we are fostering DUCKLINGS THIS YEAR)

                    <p align="justify" class="normal_text">While you await your confirmation, the kiddos can begin to research about baby ducklings habits, needs and how they grow. We have seen lovely boxes decorated  to hold the duckies for their trip home (a shoebox size is big enough), a homemade wooden duckling house, and colouring pictures to welcome duckies. Some children even name their new friends before they even arrive as part of the excitement and anticipation.<br>
                      We will supply a plastic bin / tote. You can find something larger if they outgrow this first plan. Provide a safe draft-free area, away from pets. They live inside for the first while with short trips outside on nice sunny days or rainy ducky days. No matter if they are on land or in water, DUCKS MUST ALWAYS be supervised by a responsible person.</p>
                    <p align="justify" class="normal_text">We suggest a heat lamp or a desk lamp with an old-fashioned incandescent bulb for warmth. Don't have one? We have limited quantities of heat lamps and cages for rent with your kit for an additional fee.</p></td>
