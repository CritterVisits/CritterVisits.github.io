Critter Visits are the perfect solution to mark an early milestone or a birthday in the 100’s! Our miniature farm friends are a hit with all ages, as guests engage with the mini critters and with each other. Our team will arrive and set up <b>inside or outside</b> (weather dependent and with the health and safety of you and our animals in mind).
<br><br>
<p class="header">For Inside Events</p>
<img src="img/goat_pat.png" style="padding:10px;float:left" width="150px"></img>
Tarps are set down to protect the floor then covered with a bed of straw. See-through gates create a Critter Zone and the animals are set into this area. The Critter Collection are introduced to your guests by breed, including how to pet and hold. After Masking-Up, guests are invited into the zone, to visit in appropriate-sized groups. Parents must always be near & may join them inside our gated area to take photos,  answer questions and to enjoy the experience with the kiddos.
<p class="header">For Outside Events</p>
<img src="img/kidsAnimals.png" style="padding:10px;float:left" width="150px"></img>
Our team works with your co-ordinator to find the best location for the season - shade for the heat of the day, or a warm sunny spot, out of the wind if the temperatures are cooler. The gates are set up and Critters set inside the area. Sometimes our larger animals can be led around on a leash in the backyard as a treat for the guest of honour and their friends.
