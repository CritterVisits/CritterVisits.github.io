<img src="img/fionaAnimals.png" style="padding:10px;float:left" width="150px"></img>
Critter Visits are the perfect solution to mark an early milestone or a birthday in the 100’s! Our miniature farm friends are a hit with all ages, as guests engage with the mini critters and with each other. Our team will arrive and set up <b>inside or outside</b> (weather dependent and with the health and safety of you and our animals in mind).
<br><br>
<p class="header">For Inside Events</p>
<img src="img/goat_pat.png" style="padding:10px;float:left" width="150px"></img>
Tarps are set down to protect the floor then covered with a bed of straw. See-through gates create a Critter Zone and the animals are set into this area. The Critter Collection are introduced to your guests by breed, including how to pet and hold. After Masking-Up, guests are invited into the zone, to visit in appropriate-sized groups. Parents must always be near & may join them inside our gated area to take photos,  answer questions and to enjoy the experience with the kiddos.
<br><br><br><br><br>
<p class="header">For Outside Events</p>
<img src="img/kidsAnimals.png" style="padding:10px;float:left" width="100px"></img>
Our team works with your co-ordinator to find the best location for the season - shade for the heat of the day, or a warm sunny spot, out of the wind if the temperatures are cooler. The gates are set up and Critters set inside the area. Sometimes our larger animals can be led around on a leash in the backyard as a treat for the guest of honour and their friends.
<br><br><br><br><br>
Guests are invited into the pens to spend time with the Critters - to hold and cuddle - to pet and to enjoy their unique personalities
<br>
<span class="header">Most Events</span>
<img src="img/donkey_pride.png" style="padding:10px;float:left" width="75px"></img>
Most events are 60-minutes in length and for a group of up to 10 guests. We can provide additional staff for larger groups or quote for a longer period of time. Please ask so we can customize for your needs! From darling ducklings who may take a swim, to soft and cuddly lambs to snuggle, the smiles will be plentiful and the memories golden.<br><br>
<p class="header">Fantasy Farm Friends</p>
<img src="img/karenLamb.png" style="padding:10px;float:left" width="100px"></img>
Shall we pull out all the stops and dress-up our critters in frilly, sporty, super or silly costumes? Our sporty sheep to ducks with princess dresses can follow the theme of your party. Extra fees apply.
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<p class="header">Unicorns are Real</p>
<img src="img/kidUnicorn.png" style="padding:10px;float:left" width="100px"></img>
Invite our rainbow Unicorn for walking and grooming or even pulling a Cart or Sleigh.
We can decorate the cart like a Princess’s Carriage and take your kiddos for a ride around the yard or park. Our Cart and Sleigh can hold up to 3 smaller children, two adults OR  an adult plus a kiddo or two. We have the right to work with the party host to ensure the safety of our clients and critters. Permits and permissions must be arranged by the party host if using public spaces for the ride area. Fees start at $285 with two trained and dedicated staff.<br><br>

<p class="header">Anniversaries & Family Gatherings </p>
<img src="img/oldTimePony.png" style="padding:10px;float:left" width="200px"></img>

Make the event special with the Critters arriving for all your guests. Adults can tell farm tales to wee ones, while seniors share their knowledge of living on the farm too.
<br>"Do you remember your first horse ride?"
<br>"Did I tell you the story of riding a sheep at the fair?"
<br>"I hatched eggs in my grade one class and it was such fun!"
<br>"Gramma collected eggs as her chore when she was just 5 years old!"
Let us help bring the family together in a whole new way. City slickers develop bragging rights with the first time they pet a chicken or snuggle wee piggy
<br><br>
<p class="header">School Visits</p>
Spending a full day at a school provides more than 5 classes the opportunity to link curriculum to the experience of handling live farm friends. Advance communication with our team to your teachers enhance your programs, and we focus on the life cycle, habitat or texture of our critters. High needs kiddos have animal therapy time and senior students will seek a chance to de-stress with a duck hug.<br>
Our clients have used this program in co-ordination with parent councils, rewards for scholastic excellence or fund raising, community celebrations and especially curriculum integration.<br>

<p class="header">Day Care Centres </p>
<img src="img/goat_pat.png" style="padding:10px;float:left" width="100px"></img>
Nature-programming and tactile experiences will be a highlight for kiddos. Whether watching or interacting with our mini farm friends, this year-round opportunity provides your planning team with endless possibilities. We can set up inside or outside and bring the combination of critters that you prefer. Super for an open house to promote your facility or thank your clients.<br><br><br>

<p class="header">Retirement and Senior Homes</p>
<img src="img/old_floof.png" style="padding:10px;float:left" width="150px"></img>
From our Critter of the Month option through the variations of all critters for many occasions, Critter Visits has a heart for your residents. The generation of farmers who recall their own donkey or piggie find our animals to be just like home. We have watched a chicken be held for an hour by more than one happy gramma. Stories of how a pony was the highlight of their youth, or of their hen who hid eggs for Uncle Robert to find are but a few tales we’ve been told. The city-raised folk are as delighted to hold a duckling for the first time as those who feel like it was just yesterday. Contact Karen to discuss regular sessions. Book early for family holiday events for clients, staff and all the families.<br>

<p class="header">Seasonal Parks</p>
<img src="img/pettingzoo2.png" style="padding:10px;float:left" width="150px"></img>
Recreational teams or park owners book us every year to provide a family event mid-week, weekends or holidays. Every age is engaged with the friendly farm animals of Critter Visits. Your programming funds are invested in a successful event as ducks, funky chickens, pot belly pigs and our darling bunnies join other farmyard friends for a session of snuggling. Book well in advance for that your special celebration.<br><br>

<p class="header">Day Camps</p>
<img src="img/duck_kids.png" style="padding:10px;float:left" width="150px"></img>
School, YMCA, City and Private Camps call to book Critter Visits for March Break and Summer Sessions. The flexibility for farm animals to come to your location provide the security and simplicity you desire. From an hour to a full day, we are able to set up for a custom session, inside or outside. Consider a fund-raising event or open house with Critter Visits to add to your planned success. We will customize to your precise needs.<br><br>

<p class="header">Church Groups</p>
<img src="img/church.png" style="padding:10px;float:left" width="150px"></img>
Object lessons around Palm Sunday, the 99 sheep, the Good Shepherd and of course our Live Nativity options bring the Gospel alive in a new way. Our Christian beliefs tug at our heartstrings as we attend church services with you. There is nothing more rewarding as stewards of our land, than doing programming at your location. Critter Visits also brings in the neighbourhood with an outreach or community event. Contact Karen with your inspired ideas and we will make it memorable with you.<br><br>
