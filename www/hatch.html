			Needing a special, personal "eggs-perience"? Woolley Wonderland Farm is happy to help time a clutch of eggs to hatch for a <b>birthday or other milestone</b>. It's a super way to provide egg-citement when parties just can't happen like before.<br>
      <br><span class="header">WHO CAN HATCH?</span> Schools, Families, Senior Homes, Community Groups<br>
      <br><span class="header">You won't feel alone</span> through the process. Clients love that we are an email, text or call away as they hatch their first eggs. We have YouTube links to walk you through the set-up as well as a custom manual to guide you along the hatching path.<br>
			<br>

			<br><span class="secondary=header">Our breeds</span> are heritage and show birds - high in demand by other breeders, farmers and backyard chicken lovers. We guarantee every hatch will produce chicks, ducks, geese, guinea keets or peacocks using our complete kits.<br>

      <br><span class="header">Some schools and school boards</span>have their own incubators. We can support you with a kit that includes: up to 2 dozen hatching eggs, chick starter food, vitamin supplement, food and water dishes, shavings, heat lamp and a brooder box.

      <span class="header">NOTE: All eggs may not hatch.</span> We'll do our best to guide you through the process including candling to remove most infertile eggs close to the hatch date to minimize disappointment during the final hatch days.</p>
      Our instruction guide includes information on steps to hatching, how the incubator works, illustrations on candling eggs and what to expect to see. YOU will have a specific timeline from eggs-in on day-one to hatching and brooding your chicks.<br>

      <span class="secondary-header">Candling</span> is easy to discover which eggs are viable. You can see the "spider web" at 5 days by beaming the light from your smart phone through the shell. You may also be able to see the heart beating through the shell of a viable egg at day 8.<br>
      <span class="secondary-header">LOCKDOWN</span>Lockdown is the last incubator step and marks the time  for you to get the brooder box ready. Right before they hatch, you will hear peeping as the beak breaks through the membrane inside the shell. Pipping and peeping time when the egg tooth creates a tiny hole in the shell. The chick has the tough job of pushing its way out of the egg. A newborn chick will be fine living 12 to 24-hours in the incubator before it is moved to your brooder. Even if you are not home, the chick will be fine for a full day. It can take a week for all the eggs to be finished hatching

      <span class="secondary-header">All participants </span> get an "I Hatched a Chick" or "I Hatched a Duck" collector card.<br>
