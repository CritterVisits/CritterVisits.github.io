                      Joy and giggles, laughter and squeals of delight. These are the typical reaction as families use our contact-free pick-up of just-hatched ducklings at our farm. Teachers love the low-stress having just-hatched ducklings without the wait.<br>
                      <span class="header">Woolley Wonderland Farm in Lakehurst, Ontario</span> is the location for pick-ups and returns for this program.<br>
                      Perhaps you're a parent needing an idea for home learning with your students, or you are needing to help a tween or teen dealing with isolation. Fostering a pair or more of baby ducklings has become a phenomenon.  <span class="header">We have been running this program for more than 10 years.</span><br>
                      With the returning ducks, comes stories of how caring for ducklings brings together science and nature studies, empathy and nurturing, socializing and imprinting, compassion, caring and love.<br>

Email notifications will be coming. First an order confirmation, followed by your pick up news.<br>
Watch your inbox and junk mail telling your hatched duckies are ready.  Our ducks are usually Pekins; yellow-coloured as ducklings with tiny peeps growing into white ducks with orange beaks and legs.<br>
<br>New for 2021: You can now reserve the miniature Call Ducks in April to June. Additional dates will be added as eggs go into the hatchery. These start smaller, grow slower and stay smaller than a standard duck. They will fly at 8 to 10 weeks old, if you plan to keep them a while.
<br>With our own eggs, you may get standard sized ducks in different colours and shapes from the long necked Indian Runners, ducks with tufts on top or all black Cayugas.
<br>We don’t foster baby chickens (chicks) as they will develop the wings early and begin to flutter and fly at 10 days old. Ducklings will stay on the ground, swim and bond with you. They also will adapt back to being a farm duck when they are returned to the farm. And return they must.

No worries about missing their mama. Ducks are hatched by incubator and may imprint on their foster parents following you around.  Did you know that ducklings swim by instinct the day they hatch and that they love scrambled eggs for breakfast?<br>

                Covid has many families scrambling to own a pet. <b>We thought it wise</b> to offer a program to let you test the waters first. Pets are a long-term commitment, with some rabbits living more than 15 years. For those who think a rabbit is a great idea but don't know what it's like to own one, <b>we have a solution.</b><br>
                <span class="header">Critter Visits is offering several breeds of rabbits for fostering before you adopt!</span> Let your family see if this is the right pet for right now with a month's trial with your family's current routine.<br>
                Will the kiddos change the litter? Play daily? Brush the Fur? Feed and fill the water bottle? Does it get enough attention after three weeks? If after a month you are not sure, you can extend for one more month before you decide. Often, a family knows the answer before the month is over.<br>
                <img src="img/bunny_hold.png" style="padding:10px;float:left" width="150px"></img>
                <span class="header">We supply you</span> with a cage, shavings for the bottom, a litter pan (they are litter trained), water bottle, food dish and hay rack. You also get a bucket of pellet food and a bag of hay plus our manual with basic tips. None of our bunnies are fixed.<br>
                <span class="header">Your family can come to the farm</span> and select a buck or doe, the colour they like and the breed they were hoping for.<br>
                We will assist in taking the bunny out of the cage and <b>letting you hold</b> one or two. We want to be sure it is a good fit and you are comfortable holding and picking up your new furry friend.<br>
                <span class="header">We are a call away</span> during your foster period to help you with any questions.<br>
                Remember that bunnies have claws (we will trim them after you select your bunny) and can nip. Their bones are small so gentle but firm hands are required. They must have their back feet supported for proper holding. Our <b>Introduction to Rabbits</b> manual will help you with the basics.<br>
