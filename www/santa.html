<br><p class=header>Frozen Too Adventures</p>
<br>
Dress for the outdoors! Wear your best Frozen outfits, hats, mittens, coats and capes and enjoy your wintery journey.<br>
Anna’s Kristoff is at the farm leading his shaggy “reindeer/pony” for a wintery sleigh ride around our snowy field. Lots to see and do during your time at Woolley Wonderland Farm in Lakehurst, Ontario.<br>
<br>
Reserve your specific time with Online Booking for afternoon adventures.<br>
<br>
Arrive and park by our porta-potty (for your freshening up convenience and hand sanitizing). You’ll be greeted by our staff member who will verify your booking. You’ll be introduced to our areas and led to your starting point.<br>
<br>
Wandering Oaken’s Trading Post and Sauna has a “reindeer/pony” meet and greet. Your kiddos can pet, brush and have their photos taken with our mini, shaggy equines. Bronwyn and Angus are animal therapy buddies who will warm your heart and start your Joy Journey today.  The Sauna is currently housing the Reindeer, however you can warm your body parts by a bonfire. Oaken has visiting farm friends at the trading post including a donkey, sheep and alapcas  for you to meet.<br>
<br>
Activities to entertain are next from Ring Toss with Sven, spot Bruni the Fire Spirit, and photogenic Olaf in various poses. It’s summer here all year round with Olaf on the beach! Give Olaf a warm hug or get silly for the camera in your own way. If the snow is just right, Do you want to build a snowman? or perhaps a snow chicken? We could have a complete snow farm by the time our visits are done each day. Can you build Olaf?<br>
<br>
Time to meet Kristoff. If you have a fancy dress and wish a photo moment with your “inside” Anna or Elsa costume - with Kristoff, layer up and be ready for a quick photo when the time is right. Your family will take turns being escorted on a sleigh ride. Frozen tunes will play as you glide across the snowy field. Three little kiddos OR one adult plus a child can fit on the festive sleigh. Continue to share family memories as you are led through the wintery tree-lined zone. Mix and match who is<br> in the sleigh for each ride. Take lots of video and photos to share with those outside your bubble.
<br>
Say “So-long!” to your Frozen Too Friends and wrap up your visit with final hand sanitizing before getting ready for the ride home.<br>
<br>
