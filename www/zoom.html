        <span class="header">Virtual Farm via Zoom, Google Meet + similar broadcasting products.</span>
        <br>
        We are so excited to know we can talk to people around the world about our farm, to educate, tell stories and show you our mini farm friends live online!<br>
        <span class="secondary-header">From 15 to 60 minutes</span>, Farmers Fiona, Karen or Glenn will join you and your group for an interactive chat highlighting our Critters. Visits can be scheduled weekly, semi-monthly or to your needs.<br>
        We link to you, or we can manage the call and welcome guests to the session. We'll work with your team leader in advance to best set up the theme of the day and work out possible technical bugs. Your co-ordinator will ensure all members are logged-in before reviewing guidelines for participants. (participation, muting microphones, etc).<br>
        <span class="secondary-header">Our farmer team</span> will then lead the lively discussion and interact with your group. From facts to silly trivia, the tone is set to your needs. <b>Options</b> include working with school curriculum themes, select a breed to focus on, and looking at similar traits between a few Critters. Woolley Farmers will ask questions and bring joy from our farm to you.<br>
        <span class="secondary-header">Our Critters include:</span> Nigerian Dwarf Goats, Babydoll Sheep, Alpacas, Miniature Donkeys, Shetland Ponies, Funky Chicken breeds, Rabbits, Call Ducks, Ducks, Geese, Cows, Pot Belly Pigs and Guinea Hens. <b>If there is a hatch happening</b>, your group can watch as chicks or ducklings pip and pop out of their shells. <b>When bunnies are born</b>, perhaps your timing will let your group see the smallest of our furry babies. Call back in a few weeks and see their progression! When our kids (goats) and lambs (sheep) arrive, we would love to show them off to you as well. We may be in our studio, outside or in the barn for your call; it's always a happy surprise.<br>
        <span class="secondary-header">Session Fee:</span> <b>$100 for 30 minutes or $175 for one hour (plus tax). We also have 15-minute farmer chats @ $65 and Corporate Critter Drop-In's @ $50 for 15 minutes. (no farmer chat, just a critter of choice hanging out with your meeting to bring a smile!)</b><br>
