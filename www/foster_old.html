              Joy and giggles, laughter and squeals of delight. These are the typical reaction as families get their just-hatched ducklings at our farm. Long Term Care Homes and teachers love the low-stress having day old ducklings without the wait to hatch themselves.<br>

After you place your order, you will get an auto-email with detailed information on accessing our farm as well as the contract for this program and health information. Use our <a href="https://crittervisits.checkfront.com/reserve//">on-line booking</a> under the blue FOSTER link, then select the start date that works best for you.<br>
              From July to March, the ducklings are usually Pekins; yellow-coloured as ducklings with tiny peeps growing into white ducks with orange beaks and legs.<br>
              Each spring you will be able to specify and reserve miniature Call Ducks (April to June). These ducklings will start tiny, grow slower and stay smaller than a standard duck. They can fly at 8 to 10 weeks old. With our own eggs, you may get standard sized ducks in different colours and shapes from the long necked Indian Runners, crested ducks with tufts on top or all black Cayugas.<br>
              We don’t foster baby chickens (chicks) as they will develop the wings early and begin to flutter and fly at 10 days old. You can experience chicks through our <b>hatching program</b> – 21 days from chick eggs into the incubator to hatching day. You can keep them 11 days longer before the base kit is due back to the farm. Ducklings develop their bodies first, will stay on the ground, swim and bond/imprint on you. They also will adapt back to being a farm duck when they are returned to the farm. And return they must. <b>ALL DUCKLINGS AND CHICKS must be returned to Woolley Wonderland farm per our contract with you.</b><br>

            <img src="img/duckling_walk.png" style="padding:10px;float:left" width="150px"></img><p align="justify" class="normal_text">You will need a plastic bin / tote or rabbit cage. You can find something larger if/when they outgrow your first choice. Provide a safe draft-free area, away from pets. Ducklings require warmth for the first 2 weeks. They can go outside on nice sunny days or rainy ducky days of spring and summer. No matter if they are on land or in water, <b>ducks must always be supervised</b> by a responsible person. Even a quick bathroom break for a human, with ducks left alone outside, can result in predator death.  We suggest a heat lamp or a desk lamp with an old-fashioned incandescent bulb for warmth. <b>Don't have one?</b> We have heat lamps, totes and cages for rent with your base kit for an additional fee.

                If you want to test the waters before jumping into pet ownership, this program is for you. The popularity of this program attests to the desire of families wanting to take the time to see if a rabbit a perfect pet at this time. Many of our clients have never owned a pet before! Pets are a long-term commitment, with some rabbits living more than 15 years.<br>
                <span class="header">Critter Visits is offering several breeds of rabbits for fostering before you adopt!</span> Let your family see if this is the right pet for right now with a month's trial following your family's current routine.<br>
                Discover if the kiddos change the litter? Play daily? Brush the Fur? Feed and fill the water bottle? Find out if bunny gets enough attention after three weeks? If after a month you are still not sure, you can extend for one more month before making a final decision. Often, a family knows the answer before the month is over.<br>
                <img src="img/bunny_hold.png" style="padding:10px;float:left" width="150px"></img>

                We will assist in taking the bunny out of the cage and <b>letting you hold</b> one or two. We want to be sure bunny starts as good fit and you begin to feel comfortable holding and picking up your new furry friend.<br>
                <span class="header">We are a call away </span> during your foster period to help you with any questions.<br>
                <span class="header">Our current breeds are: </span> Lionhead, Mini Rex (the velveteen bunny), Holland Lop and Netherland Dwarf (tiny ears). Ages are from a few months and up to 2 years old.<br>
